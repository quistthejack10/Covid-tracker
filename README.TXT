# Covid-tracker

This is a program I built using React Js to pull live data and track the number of cases, recovered, and deaths of covid-19 worldwide.
Other tools I used to build this website include CSS flexbox and JSON. To deploy this app I used Firebase.
The data refeshes every ten minutes.

The app is live at this url https://covid-99ecc.web.app/
